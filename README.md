# Intro to Gamedev - Final Game

[Insert game name here] is an arcade-action game with pseudo rhythm elements. The player controls a paddle that is anchored to the center of screen. The paddle moves in a fixed circle around the center. Arrows come in from all sides of the screen, and the player must rotate the paddle to block the arrows. If an arrow gets past the player, it’s game over. The pseudo rhythm element comes into play with the arrows – they will come in at a rate that matches the BPM of the music. The music is going to be electronic, which is usually the case in the arcade-action genre.

The goal of the game is to survive as long as you can. The game will time how long the player survives, and also record the high score. I plan to have 2-3 difficulties, which means a different soundtrack for each difficulty. Harder difficulties would essentially have arrows coming in at a faster rate.

The inspiration for the mechanics of this game comes from the [Undyne Fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSmt92xQ5g8) in Undertale. The inspiration for visuals and overall game feel comes from [Super Hexagon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/221640/Super_Hexagon/) and [RFLEX](https://store.steampowered.com/app/392020/RFLEX/), which are both arcade-action games that I play a lot. The art is abstract and uses simple shapes, but the games still feel very slick thanks to the “juice”.
